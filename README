VirtualBox OSE Windows Guest Additions Installer

The VirtualBox OSE does not provide an installer for the Windows Guest
Additions.  The goal of this project is to provide a simple packaged version of
the guest additions so that VirtualBox OSE users do not have to setup a Windows
build environment just to get the guest additions working.

The VirtualBox OSE source used to build the binaries in 'additions' can always
be found in 'src'.  Graphics in the 'graphics' directory are from the orange
theme distributed with NSIS.  The only tool required to build the installer is
NSIS (http://nsis.sf.net).
