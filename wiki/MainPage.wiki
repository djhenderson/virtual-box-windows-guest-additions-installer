= VirtualBox Guest Additions for Windows OSE =

Binary/Compiled version of the VirtualBox Guest Additions for Windows, Open Source Edition (OSE) version. Including installer.


= Details =

The current version of the installer, VirtualBox_OSE_GuestAdditions-2.2.0-1.exe, is based on the 2.2.0 version of VirtualBox OSE. It has been compiled with MS Visual Studio 2005 (aka Visual C++ 8.0).

It should be possible to install the additions on any VBox guest system running Windows 2000, XP, or later. Provided are the following:

 * Graphics driver
 * Mouse driver
 * OpenGL driver
 * VirtualBox.exe and .sys Guest system drivers

The installation has not been yet thoroughly tested, only on Windows XP.
Graphics performance, especially OpenGL, appears to be less than the PUEL version provided by SUN. 

Some issues are still open:
 * Clean uninstall of the drivers
 * Checking for VBox guest
 * Disallow installing when SUN xVM Guest Additions are (still) installed.

Please uninstall any Guest Additions provided by SUN or InnoTek (PUEL/commercial).
